(NEEDS EDITING) HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:

1. Unzip the project file ("3DSceneThreeJs.zip")
2. Using a terminal, navigate to the folder that was unzipped
3. In the terminal, run the following command "python3 -m http.server 8080" (Make sure Python is installed on your machine). This will start a local server at port 8080. You can choose a different port if you'd like.
4. Using an internet browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.), go to the address http://localhost:8080 (or whichever port number you specified in the previous step)
