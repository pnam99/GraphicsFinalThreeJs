HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
1. Unzip the project file ("3DSceneThreeJs.zip")
2. Using a terminal, navigate to the folder that was unzipped ("GraphicsFinalThreeJs")
3. In the terminal, run the following command "python3 -m http.server 8080" (Make sure Python is installed on your machine). This will start a local server at port 8080. You can choose a different port if you'd like.
4. Using an internet browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.), go to the address http://localhost:8080 (or whichever port number you specified in the previous step)
5. On the webpage, click the first option '3D Scene' to view the scene


NOTES (IMPORTANT!):
- The scene tends to behave slowly, varies from each machine
- Strange tip: Looking downward (90 degrees) tends to make the scene behave faster
- The camera flashlight follows the camera's position, but doesn't rotate with the camera's looking direction

'w' = Move forward
's' = Move backward
